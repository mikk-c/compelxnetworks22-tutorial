# Node Vector Distances
## Methods and Applications
### Complex Networks 22 Tutorial

Materials to follow the tutorial "Node Vector Distances: Methods and Applications," held by me at the Complex Networks 22 in Palermo, November 7th, 2022.

To run the Jupyter notebooks you will need the following:

- Python 3.10.6
- Julia 1.8.0

The following Python packages are required:

- numpy 1.23.4
- pandas 1.4.3
- networkx 2.8.6
- scipy 1.9.1
- matplotlib 3.5.2
- pyemd 0.5.1
- network_distance (download from https://www.michelecoscia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/network_distance.zip)

The following Julia packages are required:

- Graphs 1.7.2
- SimpleWeightedGraphs 1.2.1
- LightGraphs 1.3.5
- LinearAlgebra
- SparseArrays
- Distances 0.10.7
- Statistics 
- Laplacians 1.3.0

The code will likely work with different versions of the packages I listed, but those were the ones I used when creating the notebooks.
